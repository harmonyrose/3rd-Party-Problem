% Some preliminary findings and questions:

% chasing does pay off if lots of rational voters.
% chasing does not pay off if lots of party voters.
% Is there a correlation between how much each candidate chased (total sum of Euclidean distances of all chase actions) and how often they won

% does chasing ever hurt a candidate? hypothesis: if voters easily switch
% parties, and a candidate "overchases" and outruns their base, they will lose
% their base and this will hurt them. Can we reproduce this?

% Is there a correlation between how much the voting population is drifting and how likely the election at that time is to be rational?
