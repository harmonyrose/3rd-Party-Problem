% Key aspects of SD/HP: graph, opinion space, elections, modeling (not
% forecasting)

% No opinion space
In many approaches to modeling elections, voters' attitudes towards the parties
comprises merely a valence and a magnitude, rather than involving a more
complex amalgamation of issue positions. For example, in Kottonau and
Paul-Wohstl's seminal work\cite{kottonau_simulating_2004}, citizens maintain
a ``mental accounting'' of the parties over the course of an election, and the
campaigns attempt to optimize their advertising resources to influence would-be
voters at opportune times. In our model, by contrast, the main levers available
to a campaign are the party's issue positions, which they can adjust in an
attempt to woo voters.

% Election forecasting
Recently, Gao \textit{et al}\cite{gao_forecasting_2022} have presented a
promising approach to election forecasting. They combine current demographic
attributes of the population with historical results of past election outcomes
in order to determine how much each attribute is likely to influence voters,
and in which direction. This is very different from our model, both in purpose
(actually forecasting upcoming elections, rather than exploring ``what if?''
voting strategy scenarios) and in approach (the agents in
\cite{gao_forecasting_2022} do not influence one another on a social network.)

The emotion/information/opinion (E/I/O) approach, utilized by both
\cite{sobkowicz_quantitative_2016} and, more recently,
\cite{burke_quantitatively_2022}, can lead to less rigidity in model outcomes
and perhaps even conditions conducive to legitimate third parties coming into
play.
