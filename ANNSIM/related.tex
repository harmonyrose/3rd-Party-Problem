Recent work by \cite{gao_forecasting_2022} indicates that election forecasting
can be improved by using an agent-based model in addition to, or in place of,
classical forecasting metrics such as surveys, polls, and fundamentals.

The emotion/information/opinion (E/I/O) approach, utilized by both
\cite{sobkowicz_quantitative_2016} and, more recently,
\cite{burke_quantitatively_2022}, can lead to less rigidity in model outcomes
and perhaps even conditions conducive to legitimate third parties coming into
play.
