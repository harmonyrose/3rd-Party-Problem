\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Many factors are known to influence voters in democratic elections, including
their own background characteristics (demographics, ideology, partisanship,
personality traits, \textit{etc.}), the distinctiveness of the candidates, the
availability of information, and the voter's perception of their
identity.\cite[pp.3-4]{redlawsk_citizens_2020} But another major factor -- and
one we would argue \textit{should} be the most important, if citizens are
casting their votes rationally -- is the candidates' stance on the issues of
the day. At least in principle, voters are electing the candidate who will
enact policies most favorable to them if elected to office.
