% HP: pick 2 or three and discuss briefly

%More than, and less than, 3 candidates

%candidates chasing more often than just once per election (based on polling
%data between elections) ***

%the "constrained rational" voting alg

%different social network types and parameters ***

%issue importance (related to F\&F) ***

%a non-fixed voting population (voters enter/exit, influenced by parents)

In the future, we hope to explore a more
sophisticated modeling of issue importance. While the fast \& frugal
voting algorithms incorporated one "important issue", it was done in
an all-or-nothing manner. We would like to incorporate continuous, or
perhaps ranked, levels of importance to the agents' opinions. These 
would not only affect the manner in which fast \& frugal
agents cast their votes, but also impact the way voters interact
with other, being more likely to bring up important issues in interactions.

Another potential point of exploration is modifying the structure of the
simulation's underlying environment. This may be done by varying the 
number of candidates or testing 
different social network types and parameters. An entirely new dynamic may 
emerge between voters and candidates when they are in a society with different 
social and political conditions.
