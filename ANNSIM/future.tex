% HP: pick 2 or three and discuss briefly

More than, and less than, 3 candidates

candidates chasing more often than just once per election (based on polling

the "constrained rational" voting alg

different social network types and parameters

issue importance (related to F\&F)

a non-fixed voting population (voters enter/exit, influenced by parents)
