One future point of exploration is testing the sensitivity of the model to network
variance. We used an  Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graph,
but would like to test our model with different networks and edge probabilities.

Our next major step is to fit the model to empirical data by calibrating the
initial conditions and validating the outcomes with polling data. This would allow
us to model the effectiveness of vote-seeking campaigns in a real democratic
system, and arguably more importantly, identify feasible strategies to increase the 
rationality of elections.
