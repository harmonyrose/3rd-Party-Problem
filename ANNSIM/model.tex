\section{The model}
\label{sec:model}

\subsection{Overview}

%1. Overall description: voters and candidates interact in opinion space **(SD)**

\subsection{Voter agents}

%2. Voter agents **(SD)**
%    1. Modeling opinions on issues as continuous-valued vectors
%    2. How voters choose who to interact with
%    3. What happens at interaction -- CI2
%         Use the terms "openness" and "pushaway"
%         Use the terms "comparison issue" and "influenced issue"
%    4. Turnout: an voter's decision about whether or not to vote

\subsection{Elections}

%5. Elections **(HP)**
%    1. At regular points in time, elections are held, and results tabulated

To study the political impact of the CI2 mechanism, we introduce a simple
political structure in which all agents deploy one of several voting strategies
in regularly held elections. Elections are held every $N=50$ steps and results
are tabulated to determine the winner, as well as the rationality of the
outcome. An election is considered \textbf{rational} if the winning candidate
is the candidate that best represents the population in opinion space. This is
close to what Redlawsk and Habegger describe about an individual
``\textbf{voting correctly}, or matching their values to the candidate who
represents them most accurately,''\cite[p.8]{redlawsk_citizens_2020} (emphasis
original) except that we look at the outcome of the entire election. 

\subsubsection{Voting algorithms}

%    5. Different voting algorithms **(HP)**
%        * Rational
%        * Bounded Rational (or "Constrained Rational")
%        * F&F1
%        * F&F2
%        * Party-line vote



\subsection{Parties}

%3. Parties **(HP)**
%    1. How these are initialized, both for voters and candidates
%    2. Whether and how voters ever change parties

\subsection{Candidate agents}

%4. Candidate agents **(HP)**
%    1. Their issue positions are modeled similar to voter opinions
%    2. The "chase" algorithm
%         Define the terms "chasing candidate" and "non-chasing candidate"
