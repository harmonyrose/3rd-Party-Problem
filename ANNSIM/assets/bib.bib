	abstract = {We present results of an abstract, agent based model of opinion dynamics simulations based on the emotion/information/opinion (E/I/O) approach, applied to a strongly polarized society, corresponding to the Polish political scene between 2005 and 2015. Under certain conditions the model leads to metastable coexistence of two subcommunities of comparable size (supporting the corresponding opinions)—which corresponds to the bipartisan split found in Poland. Spurred by the recent breakdown of this political duopoly, which occurred in 2015, we present a model extension that describes both the long term coexistence of the two opposing opinions and a rapid, transitory change due to the appearance of a third party alternative. We provide quantitative comparison of the model with the results of polls and elections in Poland, testing the assumptions related to the modeled processes and the parameters used in the simulations. It is shown, that when the propaganda messages of the two incumbent parties differ in emotional tone, the political status quo may be unstable. The asymmetry of the emotions within the support bases of the two parties allows one of them to be ‘invaded’ by a newcomer third party very quickly, while the second remains immune to such invasion.},

	shorttitle = {Multipolar social systems},
	abstract = {Social polarization is a growing concern worldwide, as it strains social relations, erodes trust in institutions, and thus threatens democratic societies. Academic efforts to understand this phenomenon have traditionally approached it from a one-dimensional perspective, focusing on bipolar or dichotomous systems. However, political conflicts often involve not only two, but multiple potentially dissenting factions. The most representative examples are multi-party democracies, where the multilateral tensions among different parties often lead to gridlock and uncertainty. Despite the prevalence of these multipolar systems, there is still a lack of suitable analytical tools to study their intricate polarization patterns. In this work, we develop an analytical framework consisting of an inherently multipolar model for unbiased ideological spaces, a method to infer multidimensional opinions from interaction networks, and novel multidimensional polarization metrics that quantify several aspects of ideological polarization and bring new insights into the analysis of high-dimensional opinion distributions. Crucially, our multidimensional framework does not assume the underlying ideological structure, such as conservative vs progressive, liberal vs authoritarian, etc. Instead, it reveals the natural space that best describes the social landscape, which does not necessarily correspond to traditional categories. We illustrate the application of this framework in quadripolar and pentapolar real-world democratic processes, finding non-trivial ideological structures with clear connections to the underlying social context. Our methodology offers a comprehensive perspective of multilateral social tensions, as it incorporates complementary aspects of polarization: network segregation, opinion extremeness, and issue alignment.},

	abstract = {The increasing political polarization is driving hatred and segregation, and these pose a threat to democracy. While disagreement on policy issues is increasing and receiving great attention, people are also becoming more aligned across diverse and seemingly unrelated topics, leading to issue polarization and ideological sorting. Observational studies have described the rising ideological alignment and experimental work has addressed the relevant mechanisms involved in political interactions. However, how these two relevant phenomena relate to each other is still unclear. To address this question, we propose a multidimensional agent-based model that incorporates two main mechanisms: homophily, in which people who share similar opinions are more likely to interact, and ingroup-coherence favoritism, in which partisans are more attracted to coherent ingroups rather than incoherent or outgroup members. We developed and solved the model's master equations that perfectly describe the simulated model's dynamics. We found that the ideological alignment reported in political opinions in several experiments can only be explained by the presence of ingroup-coherence favoritism in pairwise interactions. By comparing the model's outcomes with more than 20,000 opinions from people living in different countries, the model can infer the weight of ingroup-coherence needed to match each other. We found a strong correspondence between the presence of this mechanism and the political content of the answers. This work helps us understand the role of ingroup-coherence favoritism in political opinion formation and sheds light on the importance of combining efforts from experimental approaches, theoretical modeling, and large-scale empirical studies.},

A necessary step in this line of endeavor is to find regularities in data referring to large-scale social phenomena, such as scaling and universality.

This finding reveals the existence in the voting process of a general microscopic dynamics that does not depend on the historical, political, and/or economical context where voters operate. A simple dynamical model for the behavior of voters, similar to a branching process, reproduces the universal distribution.},

Modelling the effect of political propaganda on a voting population has become more prevalent in opinion dynamics research, which has become further enabled by the applications of computer simulation and data analysis. In this study we explore the effect of propaganda on a voting population. The agent-based model describes a population of voter agents who hold a political opinion using knowledge and emotion as their control variables. These variables are updated through agent interactions and political propaganda. The model is based on the emotion/information/opinion (E/I/O) approach which is applied to a grid-based and network population. Furthermore, the network is programmed to be partially dynamic, in that connections between disagreeing agents can be severed under certain conditions concerning the intimacy of agent relationships. This is performed with the intention of adding more flexibility to the model, whilst making it a more realistic representation of reality. The different network types are shown to produce varying proportions of metastable agent states from identical starting conditions, which can be used to represent real political situations and predict future change.},

In campaigns aiming to influence people’s beliefs, micro-targeted campaigns (MTCs) that target specific voters using their psychological profile have become increasingly prevalent. It remains open how effective MTCs are, notably in comparison to population-targeted campaign strategies. Using an agent-based model, the paper applies recent insights from cognitive models of persuasion, extending them to the societal level in a novel framework for exploring political campaigning. The paper provides an initial treatment of the complex dynamics of population level political campaigning in a psychologically informed manner. Model simulations show that MTCs can take advantage of the psychology of the electorate by targeting voters favourable disposed towards the candidate. Relative to broad campaigning, MTCs allow for efficient and adaptive management of complex campaigns. Findings show that disliked MTC candidates can beat liked population-targeting candidates, pointing to societal questions concerning campaign regulations.},

This communication shift is also likely to affect the information dissemination dynamic; i.e., how internal attachment working models relate to virtual modes of communication. Three studies (354 participants in total, median age 27) examined the applicability of Attachment Theory to web-based social network communications. Using self- report measures (Study 1) and an experimental simulation (Study 2), the results indicate that attachment security level predicts an individual’s number of social ties and willingness to initiate web-based relationships. Secure individuals emerged as best situated to become social hubs. Study 3 reveals that a decrease in avoidance scores predicts an increased willingness to deliver information to others. Anxious participants exhibited less willingness to deliver highly threatening information but more willingness to deliver neutral information to others. These findings support the applicability of attachment internal working models to predicting web-based social network communication, and suggest that Attachment Theory can be a predictor of the dynamics of web-based dissemination of information.},

We hypothesize that information filtering processes take place on the individual, the social, and the technological levels (triple‐filter‐bubble framework). We constructed an agent‐based modelling (ABM) and analysed twelve different information filtering scenarios to answer the question under which circumstances social media and recommender algorithms contribute to fragmentation of modern society into distinct echo chambers. Simulations show that, even without any social or technological filters, echo chambers emerge as a consequence of cognitive mechanisms, such as confirmation bias, under conditions of central information propagation through channels reaching a large part of the population. When social and technological filtering mechanisms are added to the model, polarization of society into even more distinct and less interconnected echo chambers is observed. Merits and limits of the theoretical framework, and more generally of studying complex social phenomena using ABM, are discussed. Directions for future research such as ways of comparing our simulations with actual empirical data and possible measures against societal fragmentation on the three different levels are suggested.},

Different algorithms for party adaptation are explored, including “Aggregator” (adapt party policy to the ideal policy positions of party supporters), Hunter (repeat policy moves that were rewarded; otherwise make random moves), Predator (move party policy toward the policy position of the largest party), and “Sticker” (never change party policy). Strong trends in the behavior of parties using different methods of adaptation are explored. The model is then applied in a series of experiments to the dynamics of a real party system, described in a published opinion poll time series. This paper reports first steps toward endogenizing key features of the process, including the birth and death of parties, internal party decision rules, and voter ideal points.},

	abstract = {The policy positions parties choose are central to both attracting voters and forming coalition governments. How then should parties choose positions to best represent voters? Laver and Sergenti show that in an agent-based model with boundedly rational actors a decision rule (Aggregator) that takes the mean policy position of its supporters is the best rule to achieve high congruence between voter preferences and party positions. But this result only pertains to representation by the legislature, not representation by the government. To evaluate this we add a coalition formation procedure with boundedly rational parties to the Laver and Sergenti model of party competition. We also add two new decision rules that are sensitive to government formation outcomes rather than voter positions. We develop two simulations: a single-rule one in which parties with the same rule compete and an evolutionary simulation in which parties with different rules compete. In these simulations we analyze party behavior under a large number of different parameters that describe real-world variance in political parties’ motives and party system characteristics. Our most important conclusion is that Aggregators also produce the best match between government policy and voter preferences. Moreover, even though citizens often frown upon politicians’ interest in the prestige and rents that come with winning political office (office pay-offs), we find that citizens actually receive better representation by the government if politicians are motivated by these office pay-offs in contrast to politicians with ideological motivations (policy pay-offs). Finally, we show that while more parties are linked to better political representation, how parties choose policy positions affects political representation as well. Overall, we conclude that to understand variation in the quality of political representation scholars should look beyond electoral systems and take into account variation in party behavior as well.},
