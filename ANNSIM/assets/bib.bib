	abstract = {We present results of an abstract, agent based model of opinion dynamics simulations based on the emotion/information/opinion (E/I/O) approach, applied to a strongly polarized society, corresponding to the Polish political scene between 2005 and 2015. Under certain conditions the model leads to metastable coexistence of two subcommunities of comparable size (supporting the corresponding opinions)—which corresponds to the bipartisan split found in Poland. Spurred by the recent breakdown of this political duopoly, which occurred in 2015, we present a model extension that describes both the long term coexistence of the two opposing opinions and a rapid, transitory change due to the appearance of a third party alternative. We provide quantitative comparison of the model with the results of polls and elections in Poland, testing the assumptions related to the modeled processes and the parameters used in the simulations. It is shown, that when the propaganda messages of the two incumbent parties differ in emotional tone, the political status quo may be unstable. The asymmetry of the emotions within the support bases of the two parties allows one of them to be ‘invaded’ by a newcomer third party very quickly, while the second remains immune to such invasion.},

	abstract = {In the run-up to a contentious 2020 presidential election, the much-maligned American voter may indeed be wondering, “How did we get here?” A Citizen’s Guide to the Political Psychology of Voting offers a way of thinking about how voters make decisions that provides both hope and concern. In many ways, voters may be able to effectively process vast amounts of information in order to decide which candidates to vote for in concert with their ideas, values, and priorities. But human limitations in information processing must give us pause. While we all might think we want to be rational information processors, political psychologists recognize that most of the time we do not have the time or the motivation to do so. The question is, can voters do a “good enough” job even if they fail to account for everything during the campaign? Evidence suggests that they can, but it isn’t easy. Here, Redlawsk and Habegger portray a wide variety of voter styles and approaches―from the most motivated and engaged to the farthest removed and disenchanted―in vignettes that connect the long tradition of voter survey research to real life voting challenges. They explore how voters search for political information and make use of it in evaluating candidates and their positions. Ultimately, they find that American voters are reasonably competent in making well-enough informed vote choices efficiently and responsibly. For citizen voters as well as students and scholars, these results should encourage regular turnout for elections now and in the future.},

"We have developed a novel platform for forecasting elections based on agent-based modeling (ABM), which is entirely independent from surveys and polls. The platform uses statistical results from objective data along with simulation models to capture how voters have voted in past elections and how they are likely to vote in an upcoming election." (Gao :1)"opinion polls, surveys, "fundamentals" and the three approaches centered upon them, namely, opinion aggregation, structuralist models, and various synthetic methods." (Gao :1)"by pooling results from different projections, one can minimize the errors and biases with different sources and data" (Gao :1)"opinion aggregation rests on the idea of a capricious electorate that is susceptible to changes engendered by campaign dynamics." (Gao :1)"scientists have postulated that voters' preferences and voting patterns can remain fairly stable over long periods of time" (Gao :2)"Structuralists thus seek to forecast elections with models that use a limited number of core predictive economic and political indicators" (Gao :2)"the structuralist approach is less equipped to deal with events and shocks that are closer to the voting date." (Gao :2)"voters are mostly missing" (Gao :2)"Our platform has consistently performed well and often more accurately than opinion polls." (Gao :2)"we can derive some initial voting rules of agents (voters) from historical data and then deploy ABM simulation to select (or screen) for models that can capture how different voters have voted in past elections fairly accurately by matching simulated election results with the actual results of past elections." (Gao :3)"in addition to their individual attributes (e.g., age, gender, income, education, occupation), voters' electoral decision is also shaped by other driving factors including macro socioeconomic factors, candidates' attributes, and campaign dynamics. From data on all these factors and historical electoral results, we then derive some initial rules for agents' voting behavior with simple regressions." (Gao :4)"these initial rules do not have to be very accurate in the first place because ABM simulations will subsequently select models that can closely reproduce historical electoral results." (Gao :4)"Input data include micro-level social-demographic indicators of voters (e.g., age, gender, education, occupation, ethnicity, religious beliefs), macro-level structural indicators of voting environment (e.g., economic growth rate, Gini coefficient, unemployment rate), candidate features (e.g., incumbency, age, gender, education, scandals), and shock events that may have impacted elections (e.g., 9/11, the 2008 financial crisis)" (Gao :4)"define the initial voting rules for ABM simulation by calculating the "voting preference intervals" of predictive variables" (Gao :4)"these intervals merely serve the purpose of getting the simulation started" (Gao :5)"generate agents in the ABMs according to the known distributions of demographic figures" (Gao :5)"assign each agent a specific "voting preference interval" based on their unique attributes." (Gao :5)"Voters with an exact 0\% preference (i.e., an agent does not care which side wins in an election) do not vote" (Gao :6)"Models with large prediction errors (e.g., more than ±10\%) will be discarded" (Gao :6)"we estimate the effect of each variable on election results based on simple regression analysis. The quantified effects of these variables will then be aggregately incorporated into the prediction process of the fitted models selected in the third step, generating adjusted forecasting results." (Gao :6)"two sets of models with different input variables. The key difference between the two sets of models is that group A models contain occupation (agriculture, manufacturing, or service sector), whereas group B models replace it with religious beliefs." (Gao :7)"two sets of models with different input variables. A key difference between group A models and group B models is that among the variables in our models, the former contains occupation in which sector (agriculture, manufacturing, or others) whereas the latter replaces it with ethnic background."

Nothing in here about opinion space, voters finding objectively-best candidates based on issue opinions, or campaigns using position shifts to seek new voters. Citizens use “mental accounting” (essentially, maintaining a scoreboard for how much they like party A vs B over time).
Influence includes a mass media component and a party leaders component (in addition to the fellow-voter influence), but always in a good-or-bad way, not an issue-based way. (All the messages try to convince voters that party X is good or party Y is bad.)
The ways in which voters influence each other is complex, and worth looking at. Not every interaction between voters is efficacious. Their dynamic is based on the RAS model (Zaller 1992), impression formation (Lodge 1995), and attitude strength.
The “campaign strategies” are much different than ours -- rather than chasing votes by adopting issue positions, their campaigns decide when to deploy resources during the campaign to try and maximize their effectiveness. (Want to influence a voter early enough for them to lock-in, but late enough that they remember and are motivated to vote, etc.)
Voters have different “degrees of interest” in the election, which affects not only their likelihood to vote, but what their inter-citizen influence dynamics are like.
Only two parties, A and B.

	abstract = {Political advertising has become overwhelmingly focused on online platforms, with everimproving capabilities of tailored and targeted advertising to individuals. Modelling the effect of political propaganda on a voting population has become more prevalent in opinion dynamics research, which has become further enabled by the applications of computer simulation and data analysis. In this study we explore the effect of propaganda on a voting population. The agent-based model describes a population of voter agents who hold a political opinion using knowledge and emotion as their control variables. These variables are updated through agent interactions and political propaganda. The model is based on the emotion/information/opinion (E/I/O) approach which is applied to a grid-based and network population. Furthermore, the network is programmed to be partially dynamic, in that connections between disagreeing agents can be severed under certain conditions concerning the intimacy of agent relationships. This is performed with the intention of adding more flexibility to the model, whilst making it a more realistic representation of reality. The different network types are shown to produce varying proportions of metastable agent states from identical starting conditions, which can be used to represent real political situations and predict future change.},
