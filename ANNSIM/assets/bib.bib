	abstract = {We present results of an abstract, agent based model of opinion dynamics simulations based on the emotion/information/opinion (E/I/O) approach, applied to a strongly polarized society, corresponding to the Polish political scene between 2005 and 2015. Under certain conditions the model leads to metastable coexistence of two subcommunities of comparable size (supporting the corresponding opinions)—which corresponds to the bipartisan split found in Poland. Spurred by the recent breakdown of this political duopoly, which occurred in 2015, we present a model extension that describes both the long term coexistence of the two opposing opinions and a rapid, transitory change due to the appearance of a third party alternative. We provide quantitative comparison of the model with the results of polls and elections in Poland, testing the assumptions related to the modeled processes and the parameters used in the simulations. It is shown, that when the propaganda messages of the two incumbent parties differ in emotional tone, the political status quo may be unstable. The asymmetry of the emotions within the support bases of the two parties allows one of them to be ‘invaded’ by a newcomer third party very quickly, while the second remains immune to such invasion.},

	abstract = {In the run-up to a contentious 2020 presidential election, the much-maligned American voter may indeed be wondering, “How did we get here?” A Citizen’s Guide to the Political Psychology of Voting offers a way of thinking about how voters make decisions that provides both hope and concern. In many ways, voters may be able to effectively process vast amounts of information in order to decide which candidates to vote for in concert with their ideas, values, and priorities. But human limitations in information processing must give us pause. While we all might think we want to be rational information processors, political psychologists recognize that most of the time we do not have the time or the motivation to do so. The question is, can voters do a “good enough” job even if they fail to account for everything during the campaign? Evidence suggests that they can, but it isn’t easy. Here, Redlawsk and Habegger portray a wide variety of voter styles and approaches―from the most motivated and engaged to the farthest removed and disenchanted―in vignettes that connect the long tradition of voter survey research to real life voting challenges. They explore how voters search for political information and make use of it in evaluating candidates and their positions. Ultimately, they find that American voters are reasonably competent in making well-enough informed vote choices efficiently and responsibly. For citizen voters as well as students and scholars, these results should encourage regular turnout for elections now and in the future.},

"We have developed a novel platform for forecasting elections based on agent-based modeling (ABM), which is entirely independent from surveys and polls. The platform uses statistical results from objective data along with simulation models to capture how voters have voted in past elections and how they are likely to vote in an upcoming election." (Gao :1)"opinion polls, surveys, "fundamentals" and the three approaches centered upon them, namely, opinion aggregation, structuralist models, and various synthetic methods." (Gao :1)"by pooling results from different projections, one can minimize the errors and biases with different sources and data" (Gao :1)"opinion aggregation rests on the idea of a capricious electorate that is susceptible to changes engendered by campaign dynamics." (Gao :1)"scientists have postulated that voters' preferences and voting patterns can remain fairly stable over long periods of time" (Gao :2)"Structuralists thus seek to forecast elections with models that use a limited number of core predictive economic and political indicators" (Gao :2)"the structuralist approach is less equipped to deal with events and shocks that are closer to the voting date." (Gao :2)"voters are mostly missing" (Gao :2)"Our platform has consistently performed well and often more accurately than opinion polls." (Gao :2)"we can derive some initial voting rules of agents (voters) from historical data and then deploy ABM simulation to select (or screen) for models that can capture how different voters have voted in past elections fairly accurately by matching simulated election results with the actual results of past elections." (Gao :3)"in addition to their individual attributes (e.g., age, gender, income, education, occupation), voters' electoral decision is also shaped by other driving factors including macro socioeconomic factors, candidates' attributes, and campaign dynamics. From data on all these factors and historical electoral results, we then derive some initial rules for agents' voting behavior with simple regressions." (Gao :4)"these initial rules do not have to be very accurate in the first place because ABM simulations will subsequently select models that can closely reproduce historical electoral results." (Gao :4)"Input data include micro-level social-demographic indicators of voters (e.g., age, gender, education, occupation, ethnicity, religious beliefs), macro-level structural indicators of voting environment (e.g., economic growth rate, Gini coefficient, unemployment rate), candidate features (e.g., incumbency, age, gender, education, scandals), and shock events that may have impacted elections (e.g., 9/11, the 2008 financial crisis)" (Gao :4)"define the initial voting rules for ABM simulation by calculating the "voting preference intervals" of predictive variables" (Gao :4)"these intervals merely serve the purpose of getting the simulation started" (Gao :5)"generate agents in the ABMs according to the known distributions of demographic figures" (Gao :5)"assign each agent a specific "voting preference interval" based on their unique attributes." (Gao :5)"Voters with an exact 0\% preference (i.e., an agent does not care which side wins in an election) do not vote" (Gao :6)"Models with large prediction errors (e.g., more than ±10\%) will be discarded" (Gao :6)"we estimate the effect of each variable on election results based on simple regression analysis. The quantified effects of these variables will then be aggregately incorporated into the prediction process of the fitted models selected in the third step, generating adjusted forecasting results." (Gao :6)"two sets of models with different input variables. The key difference between the two sets of models is that group A models contain occupation (agriculture, manufacturing, or service sector), whereas group B models replace it with religious beliefs." (Gao :7)"two sets of models with different input variables. A key difference between group A models and group B models is that among the variables in our models, the former contains occupation in which sector (agriculture, manufacturing, or others) whereas the latter replaces it with ethnic background."

Nothing in here about opinion space, voters finding objectively-best candidates based on issue opinions, or campaigns using position shifts to seek new voters. Citizens use “mental accounting” (essentially, maintaining a scoreboard for how much they like party A vs B over time).
Influence includes a mass media component and a party leaders component (in addition to the fellow-voter influence), but always in a good-or-bad way, not an issue-based way. (All the messages try to convince voters that party X is good or party Y is bad.)
The ways in which voters influence each other is complex, and worth looking at. Not every interaction between voters is efficacious. Their dynamic is based on the RAS model (Zaller 1992), impression formation (Lodge 1995), and attitude strength.
The “campaign strategies” are much different than ours -- rather than chasing votes by adopting issue positions, their campaigns decide when to deploy resources during the campaign to try and maximize their effectiveness. (Want to influence a voter early enough for them to lock-in, but late enough that they remember and are motivated to vote, etc.)
Voters have different “degrees of interest” in the election, which affects not only their likelihood to vote, but what their inter-citizen influence dynamics are like.
Only two parties, A and B.

Modelling the effect of political propaganda on a voting population has become more prevalent in opinion dynamics research, which has become further enabled by the applications of computer simulation and data analysis. In this study we explore the effect of propaganda on a voting population. The agent-based model describes a population of voter agents who hold a political opinion using knowledge and emotion as their control variables. These variables are updated through agent interactions and political propaganda. The model is based on the emotion/information/opinion (E/I/O) approach which is applied to a grid-based and network population. Furthermore, the network is programmed to be partially dynamic, in that connections between disagreeing agents can be severed under certain conditions concerning the intimacy of agent relationships. This is performed with the intention of adding more flexibility to the model, whilst making it a more realistic representation of reality. The different network types are shown to produce varying proportions of metastable agent states from identical starting conditions, which can be used to represent real political situations and predict future change.},

Different algorithms for party adaptation are explored, including “Aggregator” (adapt party policy to the ideal policy positions of party supporters), Hunter (repeat policy moves that were rewarded; otherwise make random moves), Predator (move party policy toward the policy position of the largest party), and “Sticker” (never change party policy). Strong trends in the behavior of parties using different methods of adaptation are explored. The model is then applied in a series of experiments to the dynamics of a real party system, described in a published opinion poll time series. This paper reports first steps toward endogenizing key features of the process, including the birth and death of parties, internal party decision rules, and voter ideal points.},

	abstract = {The policy positions parties choose are central to both attracting voters and forming coalition governments. How then should parties choose positions to best represent voters? Laver and Sergenti show that in an agent-based model with boundedly rational actors a decision rule (Aggregator) that takes the mean policy position of its supporters is the best rule to achieve high congruence between voter preferences and party positions. But this result only pertains to representation by the legislature, not representation by the government. To evaluate this we add a coalition formation procedure with boundedly rational parties to the Laver and Sergenti model of party competition. We also add two new decision rules that are sensitive to government formation outcomes rather than voter positions. We develop two simulations: a single-rule one in which parties with the same rule compete and an evolutionary simulation in which parties with different rules compete. In these simulations we analyze party behavior under a large number of different parameters that describe real-world variance in political parties’ motives and party system characteristics. Our most important conclusion is that Aggregators also produce the best match between government policy and voter preferences. Moreover, even though citizens often frown upon politicians’ interest in the prestige and rents that come with winning political office (office pay-offs), we find that citizens actually receive better representation by the government if politicians are motivated by these office pay-offs in contrast to politicians with ideological motivations (policy pay-offs). Finally, we show that while more parties are linked to better political representation, how parties choose policy positions affects political representation as well. Overall, we conclude that to understand variation in the quality of political representation scholars should look beyond electoral systems and take into account variation in party behavior as well.},

Sources of influence can be divided as external, which are independent of social context, or as originating from peers, such as family and friends. An important question is how to disentangle the social contagion by peers from external influences. While a variety of experimental and observational studies provided insight into this problem, identifying the extent of contagion based on large-scale observational data with an unknown network structure remains largely unexplored. By bridging the gap between the large-scale complex systems perspective of collective human dynamics and the detailed approach of social sciences, we present a parsimonious model of social influence, and apply it to a central topic in political science—elections and voting behavior. We provide an analytical expression of the county vote-share distribution, which is in excellent agreement with almost a century of observed U.S. presidential election data. Analyzing the social influence topography over this period reveals an abrupt phase transition from low to high levels of social contagion, and robust differences among regions. These results suggest that social contagion effects are becoming more instrumental in shaping large-scale collective political behavior, with implications on democratic electoral processes and policies.},

	abstract = {The present research investigates how psychological mechanisms and social network structures generate patterns of cultural change and diversity. The two psychological mechanisms studied here are cultural drift and indirect minority influence; the former is parameterized by an error rate (ε) and the latter by a leniency threshold (λ). The patterns of cultural change are examined in terms of magnitude (small vs large), speed (gradual vs rapid), and frequency (frequent vs rare). Diversity and polarization in a society are examined in terms of global cultural variation (inverse Simpson index) and local neighborhood difference (Hamming distance). Key findings are that in networks with high connectivity or local community structures (complete, scale-free, random, and modular networks) cultural drift can produce a rapid, large, and rare pattern of cultural change (punctuated equilibrium), whereas in lattice or small world networks, it produces a more gradual change pattern. Indirect minority influence robustly produces a gradual, small, and frequent pattern of cultural change (gradualism) across various network structures. When cultural change occurs in social networks that have a modular community structure, indirect minority influence generates a regime of cultural diversity whereas cultural drift generates a polarized regime. Finally, cultural drift and indirect minority influence generate distinct tipping points for social change in different network structures, but prediction of whether and when cultural change emerges is difficult at tipping points in both cases.},

"When cultural change occurs in social networks that have a modular community structure, indirect minority influence generates a regime of cultural diversity whereas cultural drift generates a polarized regime." (Jung et al 2021:3)
"indirect minority influence is controlled by a leniency threshold parameter, which captures the extent to which societal members listen to minority dissent with an open mind." (Jung et al 2021:5)
"Although numerous computational models reveal causal relationships between psychological mechanisms and cultural change, no systematic analysis has been undertaken to demonstrate whether a particular cultural pattern or rate of change can be attributed solely to a specific psychological mechanism or some combination of them, or if these patterns and rates of change are primarily an effect of network characteristics."

"Both stubbornness and conformity have been identified as critical factors that can spread small errors and rare variants to a society" (Jung et al 2021:8)
"leniency contract" (Jung et al 2021:9)
"a leniency contract : an implicit agreement stipulating that the majority will attend to a dissenting ingroup minority opinion, thereby maintaining the viability and cohesion of the group as a whole. In turn, the minority implicitly accepts that a change in the focal belief is unlikely." (Jung et al 2021:9)
"even though direct focal attitude change is unlikely, the majority's open-minded tolerance of the minority position creates cognitive pressure that can result in a change of related attitudes within the same belief system, in the direction of the thrust of the minority's argument. As indirect changes accumulate, delayed focal change can occur due to a tendency to maintain internal consistency within the belief system" (Jung et al 2021:9)
"Each agent j has attitudes on ten issues, and each attitude i takes binary values; thus, there are 210 = 1024 possible attitude profiles. Adjacent attitudes (i− 1, i + 1) are considered issues related to a focal issue i (e.g., euthanasia and pro-choice; ban on homosexual soldiers and gun control, Alvaro \& Crano, 1997). The first and last attitudes are considered as related attitudes to resolve a potential edge effect." (Jung et al 2021:14)
"attitudes as internally consistent or cognitively balanced if the adjacent attitudes take the same value as the focal one (000 or 111)." (Jung et al 2021:14)

"random order without replacement" (Jung et al 2021:15)
"When selected, an agent may potentially change an attitude. To do so, it first randomly chooses what we call a focal attitude i." (Jung et al 2021:15)
"If no error occurs and there exists a minority agent in the ingroup that is consistent in its focal and related attitudes (i− 1 = i = i + 1), then with a probability equal to the leniency threshold λ, the active agent changes one of its related issues (i− 1 or i + 1) to the minority position. Otherwise, the active agent conforms to the majority position on the focal issue i." (Jung et al 2021:16)

"The combination of the effective number of types and Hamming distance can identify three types of regimes. Diversity regimes have close to two types and a large Hamming distance, indicating blue and yellow agents are intermixed. Polarization regimes also have close to two types but a small Hamming distance, indicating similar numbers of blue and yellow agents are segregated. Majority regimes have closer to one type and a small Hamming distance, indicating either blue or yellow agents are dominant." (Jung et al 2021:18)

They have raised a fair amount of attention in the communities of social simulation, sociophysics and complexity science. The researchers working on it come from disciplines such as physics, mathematics, computer science, social psychology and philosophy.In these models agents hold continuous opinions which they can gradually adjust if they hear the opinions of others. The idea of bounded confidence is that agents only interact if they are close in opinion to each other. Usually, the models are analyzed with agent-based simulations in a Monte Carlo style, but they can also be reformulated on the agent's density in the opinion space in a master equation style. The contribution of this survey is fourfold. First, it will present the agent-based and density-based modeling frameworks including the cases of multidimensional opinions and heterogeneous bounds of confidence. Second, it will give the bifurcation diagrams of cluster configuration in the homogeneous model with uniformly distributed initial opinions. Third, it will review the several extensions and the evolving phenomena which have been studied so far, and fourth it will state some open questions.},

Here, we demonstrate that bi-polarization can be explained without negative influence, drawing on theories that emphasize the communication of arguments as central mechanism of influence. Due to homophily, actors interact mainly with others whose arguments will intensify existing tendencies for or against the issue at stake. We develop an agent-based model of this theory and compare its implications to those of existing social-influence models, deriving testable hypotheses about the conditions of bi-polarization. Hypotheses were tested with a group-discussion experiment (N = 96). Results demonstrate that argument exchange can entail bi-polarization even when there is no negative influence.},

Computer simulation demonstrates that these models are alternative explanations for the finding that different cultural tastes and practices are concentrated within different sociodemographic segments of society. Conflicting implications of the two models are identified. Although both models predict that cultural forms compete for people (i.e., people are a scarce resource on which cultural forms depend), the distancing model differs from the homophily model in that the distancing model predicts a dual ecology: Not only do cultural forms compete for people, but people compete for cultural forms. According to the distancing model, the larger the segment of society in which a cultural form is liked, the smaller is the proportion of people in that segment of society who like that cultural form. The homophily model predicts that people do not compete for cultural forms. Instead, it predicts a local bandwagon effect: The larger the segment of society in which a cultural form is liked, the larger is the proportion of people in that segment of society who like that cultural form. An empirical test using 1993 General Social Survey data supports the prediction of both models that cultural forms compete for people. The analysis also reveals a local bandwagon effect, yielding further empirical support for the homophily model and disconfirming the distancing model's prediction of a dual ecology.},

However, this emergent cultural diversity has proven to be unstable in the face of cultural drift-small errors or innovations that allow cultures to change from within. The authors develop a model of cultural differentiation that combines the traditional mechanisms of homophily and influence with a third mechanism of network homophily, in which network structure co-evolves with cultural interaction. Results show that in certain regions of the parameter space, these co-evolutionary dynamics can lead to patterns of cultural diversity that are stable in the presence of cultural drift. The authors address the implications of these findings for understanding the stability of cultural diversity in the face of increasing technological trends toward globalization.

	abstract = {One of the democratic promises of social media relies on the expectation that citizens will be exposed to more diverse sources of information and will consequently be more likely to encounter views that challenge their beliefs and opinions. Still, recent evidence suggests that although social media may increase exposure to difference, citizen also take active steps to reduce the dissonance they encounter by engaging in selective avoidance tactics such as political unfriending and unfollowing. We report the findings from the first comparative study of political unfriending conducted in Asia, which analyzes survey data from two Chinese societies, Hong Kong and Taiwan. We find that political interest, political discussion network size, and political discussion with distant others all predict the likelihood of engaging in selective avoidance on social media. The results also suggest that political interest is a stronger predictor of unfriending in Hong Kong, while social and psychological factors play a more important role in Taiwan.},

	abstract = {Party politics in the European Parliament (EP) consists of competition between transnational party groups, each consisting of multiple national member parties from the 27 member states of the European Union (EU). Identifying the policy space that these parties inhabit and their ideological positions is both practically and conceptually challenging. In this article we characterize this policy competition by tracking EP political groups from three separate, original expert surveys taken in 2004, 2007 and 2010. We look at the relative positioning of the groups on multiple dimensions of policy, as well as changes in party group policy since 2004. Additionally, we characterize the policy cohesion of party groups by examining the relative positions of each group’s constituent parties, using independent national-level expert surveys. The results reinforce previous findings that EP party groups occupy the entire range of the left–right spectrum and, moreover, that their national party makeup consists of parties that are broadly cohesive in terms of their policy locations.},

Content analysis of presidential spots and debates revealed Democrats discuss Democratic issues more (and Republican issues less) in primary than general television spots and debates. Republicans address Republican issues more (and Democratic issues less) in primary than general spots, although not in debates. Thus, presidential candidates adapt their television spot messages for the target audience; it is possible that Republican issues are discussed more in debates.},

	abstract = {Opinion dynamics concerns social processes through which populations or groups of individuals agree or disagree on specific issues. As such, modelling opinion dynamics represents an important research area that has been progressively acquiring relevance in many different domains. Existing approaches have mostly represented opinions through
discrete
binary or
continuous
variables by exploring a whole panoply of cases: e.g. independence, noise, external effects, multiple issues. In most of these cases the crucial ingredient is an attractive dynamics through which similar or similar enough agents get closer. Only rarely the possibility of explicit disagreement has been taken into account (i.e., the possibility for a repulsive interaction among individuals’ opinions), and mostly for discrete or 1-dimensional opinions, through the introduction of additional model parameters. Here we introduce a new model of opinion formation, which focuses on the interplay between the possibility of explicit disagreement, modulated in a self-consistent way by the existing opinions’ overlaps between the interacting individuals, and the effect of external information on the system. Opinions are modelled as a
vector of continuous
variables related to
multiple possible choices
for an issue. Information can be modulated to account for promoting multiple possible choices. Numerical results show that extreme information results in segregation and has a limited effect on the population, while milder messages have better success and a cohesion effect. Additionally, the initial condition plays an important role, with the population forming one or multiple clusters based on the initial average similarity between individuals, with a transition point depending on the number of opinion choices.},
