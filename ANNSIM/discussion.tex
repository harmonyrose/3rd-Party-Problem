In our model, both the rationality of elections and the efficacy of candidate chasing depend
crucially on the makeup of the electorate. Chasing votes through opinion
adjustment proves to be an extremely beneficial campaigning strategy when the
electorate is comprised of rational voters. In this environment, any number of
chasers stand to gain a significant number of votes by chasing, proving this
algorithm is effective in an ideal system.

We find that a balanced distribution of rational, party-line, and fast \&
frugal voters in the model is conducive to benefiting one chasing candidate. If two
candidates are chasing votes, we observe a much more modest advantage. As we
see with real political campaigns, adopting centrist-leaning opinions to appeal
to the masses is a sound strategy. However, our model shows this strategy has a diminishing
return on investment as two candidates fight over the same voters who aren't
guaranteed to vote rationally, providing an unexpected advantage to a third
candidate who has a solidified voter base.
	
We predicted a modest increase in the model's rationality over time
when initialized with all party-line or fast \& frugal voters and all chasing candidates. It seemed probable
that party-line and fast \& frugal voters would vote for the rational candidate more often
upon being ``chased''. However, the voters and candidates end up engaging in a blind dance
of sorts, where neither candidates nor voters know what is best for them. 
We in fact observe a decrease in the rationality of elections
over time under these conditions. 
The blind dance becomes a race to the bottom in which candidates are
fruitlessly chasing votes and voters are unknowingly electing candidates that
don't represent their beliefs. This effect is a bit more modest with fast \&
frugal voters than it is with party-line, but the trend remains in any voter
distribution that is not rational.

These results may offer an explanation as to why real campaigns rely on strategies like emotional
messaging and playing up hot topic issues. Despite the fact that matching
voters where they are opinion-wise is an optimal strategy to \textit{represent}
the greatest number of voters, the real electorate is not rational. Oftentimes, they
will not elect the candidate that most closely represents their beliefs.
Rather, they will make the easy, and ``good enough'' decision by single-issue
voting or party voting. The model shows that while chasing is an exceptional strategy for a rational, or even partially
rational electorate, there comes a point where if enough voters are making
trade-offs for a quick decision, chasing only serves to make matters worse.
