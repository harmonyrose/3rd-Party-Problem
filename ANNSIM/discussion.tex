\subsection{Candidate chasing}

%1. General findings about candidate "chasing." Do candidates tend to chase the
%same amount? Do high-chasers tend to do better in elections than low-chasers?
%Etc. **(SD)**

\subsection{Electorate's voting algorithm composition}

%2. General findings about voter algorithm mix. How much does this matter? How
%often are elections rational based on various compositions? Do certain voter
%algorithms make drifting less/more effective? **(HP)**
