% To do: here's how Stephen compiles the paper from the ANNSIM directory:
% pdflatex scs23paper.tex 
% bibtex scs23paper
% pdflatex scs23paper.tex
% pdflatex scs23paper.tex
%
% By putting this into an alias in my .bashrc with:
% alias lt="pdflatex scs23paper.tex ; bibtex scs23paper ; pdflatex % scs23paper.tex ; pdflatex scs23paper.tex"
% I can compile the paper to a PDF in one shot.
%
% When adding new papers to Zotero, be sure to put them in the ANNSIM folder
% (or subfolder), then highlight all and Export... to BibTex mode, saving the
% file under the name bib.bib (in assets subdirectory). Don't forget to commit
% your changes to bib.bib as well as your changes to any of the .text files!
