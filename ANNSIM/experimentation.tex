\subsection{Verification}
% 1. Verification: sanity-checking that the model works as designed **(SD)**

\subsection{Independent variables}

% **(HP)**
% From Jan 3 meeting:
% I.v.’s
%   Pushaway and openness thresholds (set to .1 and .6)
%   Number of parties (set to 3)
%   Threshold for voters changing parties (set to same as chase dist)
%   Chase dist: how far candidates let themselves chase (set to same as party switch thresh)
%   Fractions of the voting algorithms (sweep)
% 
% 

\subsection{Dependent variables}

% **(SD)**
% D.v.’s
%   Likelihood that election #n will turn out rational, for 1 <= n <= 8.
%   Time to stability (both for voter opinions (possibly measured by # of buckets) and for candidate opinions)
