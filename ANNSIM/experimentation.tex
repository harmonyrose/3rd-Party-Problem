\subsection{Verification}
% 1. Verification: sanity-checking that the model works as designed **(SD)**
%   CI2 mechanism does reach fixed point
%   Candidates do chase correctly, and do stop chasing
%   Verified that both voter opinions and candidate opinions asymptote to zero
%   together

\subsection{Independent variables}

%- i.v.'s: SD focuses on candidate actions (i.e., how much they chase, etc.) and
%  HP focuses on voter actions (ie., the mix of algorithms)
%
%SD holds fixed: 1/3rd, 1/3rd, 1/6th, 1/6th
%    party switch thresh .2
%    openness .1
%    pushaway .6
%    edge probability .2
%
%HP holds fixed:
%    chase radius .2
%    num_chasers 3
%    num_candidates 3
%
%
%Both hold fixed:
%    num_opinions
%    N
%    
%- d.v.'s: one of us focuses on candidate winning, and the other focuses on
%  election rationality  


\subsection{Dependent variables}

% **(SD)**
% D.v.â€™s
%   Likelihood that election #n will turn out rational, for 1 <= n <= 8.
%   Candidate winning
%   Party switches
