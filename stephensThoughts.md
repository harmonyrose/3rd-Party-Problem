# First steps:
* There are candidates, and those candidates have opinion vectors (and possibly
other stuff)
* There is a timeline in which elections happen at intervals
* There is an algorithm (or set of algorithms) for choosing a candidate to vote for (we could model different agents with different algs like in the book, or we could start with just all rational)

# Optional:
* What do candidates do to influence anything? (Do they broadcast their opinions?)
* Partial information: some voters may not know the opinion value of every candidate on every issue?
* Polls: every n clock ticks, a certain fraction of the electorate is "polled" and those numbers made public, and now voters can use those numbers to decide which candidates are viable.
* There is an algorithm (or set of algorithms) for a voter to choose whether to vote.
